# Differential Expression Workflow

In this lesson we will discuss the alignment and gene quantification steps which are necessary prior to testing for differential expression, the topic of Day 2.

| Step | Task |
| :--: | ---- |
| 1 | Experimental Design |
| 2 | Biological Samples / Library Preparation |
| 3 | Sequence Reads |
| 4 | Assess Quality of Raw Reads |
| **5** | **Splice-aware Mapping to Genome** |
| **6** | **Count Reads Associated with Genes** |
| 7 | Test for DE Genes |

# Alignment and Gene Quantification

The FASTQ files of raw sequenced reads are untethered from any notion of where they came from in the genome, and which transcribed genes the sequence belongs to. The alignment and gene quantification steps fill in that gap and allow us to proceed with the question we are really interested in: Which genes are differentially expressed between groups of samples?

We will use RSEM ([paper](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-12-323) and [GitHub](https://github.com/deweylab/RSEM)) combined with STAR Aligner ([paper](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/29/1/15/272537) and [GitHub](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR)) to accomplish the task of read mapping and gene quantifcation simultaneously.

## STAR

The "Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference" (STAR) Aligner is aware of splice-sites of transcripts and is able to align reads that span them. The figure below illustrates the difference between splice-unaware aligners (e.g. Bowtie2) and splice-aware aligners (e.g. STAR).

Some benefits of splice-aware aligners include:

* Fewer reads are discarded for lack of alignments, leading to more accurate gene quantification.
* Direct evidence of isoform usage is possible.

We should note that the default parameters for STAR are optimized for **mammalian genomes**.

## RSEM

RSEM (RNA-seq by Expectation Maximization) determines gene and isoform abundance using an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm on the relative percentage of isoform usage. From there, gene-level quantification is reported by effectively collapsing the isoform quantifications.

The primary issue that RSEM attempts to solve is that reads can align to multiple isoforms (when, for example, they share an exon), and that creates ambiguity in deciding which isoform a read gets assigned to for quantification.

# Running RSEM + STAR

RSEM can be run with just two commands: the first `rsem-prepare-reference` ([manual](https://deweylab.github.io/RSEM/rsem-prepare-reference.html)) builds an index for STAR and RSEM to use, and the second `rsem-calculate-expression` ([manual](https://deweylab.github.io/RSEM/rsem-calculate-expression.html)) does the alignment and gene quantification.

## `rsem-prepare-reference`

 A reference index is essentially a lookup table that speeds up the finding of sequence matches for alignment. In the case of a splice-aware aligner, the reference index is also aware of the various isoforms of genes in the gene model.

To use `rsem-prepare-reference` ([manual](https://deweylab.github.io/RSEM/rsem-prepare-reference.html)) we would need the FASTA sequence for the reference genome, and the gene model in the form of a GTF, as discussed in the previous section.

> **Note**: We will avoid running RSEM + STAR in this workshop because of the computational requirements and our limited Amazon instance. We would also recommend not running it on a personal computer for the same reason.

If we were to have a genome FASTA in hand, call it `GRCm38.fasta` and a GTF in hand, call it `GRCm38.gtf`, then we would create the reference index by calling:

```
$ rsem-prepare-reference --gtf /path/to/GRCm38.gtf \
                         --star \
                         --num-threads 8 \
                         /path/to/GRCm38
                         /desired/path/to/index/GRCm38
```

**Note**, the `/path/to/GRCm38` line is a bit odd in that we might expect to give the path to the genome FASTA file, but `rsem-prepare-reference` only wants the *prefix*, so everything up to the file extension.

The result of `rsem-prepare-reference` is a folder containing files for RSEM and STAR to be able to look up genomic location and gene model information as quickly and efficiently as possible.

## `rsem-calculate-expression`

After preparing the reference index, we can do alignment and quantification with the `rsem-calculate-expression` ([manual](https://deweylab.github.io/RSEM/rsem-calculate-expression.html)) command using the FASTQ reads and the path to the reference index:

```
$ rsem-calculate-expression --star \
                            --num-threads 8 \
                            --star-gzipped-read-file \
                            --star-output-genome-bam \
                            --paired-end \
                            /path/to/example_R1.fastq.gz /path/to/example_R2.fastq.gz \
                            /path/to/index/GRCm38
                            /path/to/example
```

RSEM + STAR, with the above options, outputs the following files:

| File | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `example.genes.results` | Gene-level results to be used in downstream DE analysis. |
| `example.isoforms.results` | Isoform-level results. Not used. |
| `example.genome.bam` | The BAM encoded alignments in genomic coordinates. Can be used for visualization in a gennome browser such as [IGV](https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/). |
| `example.transcript.bam` | The BAM encoded alignments in transcriptomic coordinates. |

# Output of RSEM + STAR

The two results we will use most often from RSEM + STAR are the `example.genes.results` and `example.genome.bam` files. Let's look at them each in more detail:

## `example.genes.results`

If we were to use `head` on the file we would see:

```
gene_id transcript_id(s)        length  effective_length        expected_count  TPM     FPKM
ENSMUSG00000000001      ENSMUST00000000001      3262.00 3116.28 601.00  45.50   36.70
ENSMUSG00000000003      ENSMUST00000000003,ENSMUST00000114041   799.50  653.78  0.00    0.00    0.00
```

The columns of the file are:

| Column | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| gene_id | The ID from the gene model GTF. |
| transcript_id(s) | The transcript IDs corresponding to the gene in the gene model GTF. |
| length | The weighted average of its transcripts' lengths. |
| effective_length | The weighted average, over its transcripts, of the mean number of positions from which a fragment may start within the sequence of transcript. |
| expected_count | The sum, over all tra
