# Differential Expression Workflow

In this lesson we will discuss the alignment and gene quantification steps which are necessary prior to testing for differential expression, the topic of Day 2.

| Step | Task |
| :--: | ---- |
| 1 | Experimental Design |
| 2 | Biological Samples / Library Preparation |
| 3 | Sequence Reads |
| 4 | Assess Quality of Raw Reads |
| **5** | **Splice-aware Mapping to Genome** |
| **6** | **Count Reads Associated with Genes** |
| 7 | Test for DE Genes |

# Alignment and Gene Quantification

The FASTQ files of raw sequenced reads are untethered from any notion of where they came from in the genome, and which transcribed genes the sequence belongs to. The alignment and gene quantification steps fill in that gap and allow us to proceed with the question we are really interested in: Which genes are differentially expressed between groups of samples?

We will use RSEM ([paper](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-12-323) and [GitHub](https://github.com/deweylab/RSEM)) combined with STAR Aligner ([paper](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/29/1/15/272537) and [GitHub](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR)) to accomplish the task of read mapping and gene quantifcation simultaneously.

## STAR

The "Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference" (STAR) Aligner is aware of splice-sites of transcripts and is able to align reads that span them. The figure below illustrates the difference between splice-unaware aligners (e.g. Bowtie2) and splice-aware aligners (e.g. STAR).

Some benefits of splice-aware aligners include:

* Fewer reads are discarded for lack of alignments, leading to more accurate gene quantification.
* Direct evidence of isoform usage is possible.

We should note that the default parameters for STAR are optimized for **mammalian genomes**.

## RSEM

RSEM (RNA-seq by Expectation Maximization) determines gene and isoform abundance using an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm on the relative percentage of isoform usage. From there, gene-level quantification is reported by effectively collapsing the isoform quantifications.

The primary issue that RSEM attempts to solve is that reads can align to multiple isoforms (when, for example, they share an exon), and that creates ambiguity in deciding which isoform a read gets assigned to for quantification. See the image below for an illustration of this problem.

# Running RSEM+STAR

RSEM can be run with just two commands: the first `rsem-prepare-reference` ([manual](https://deweylab.github.io/RSEM/rsem-prepare-reference.html)) builds an index for STAR and RSEM to use, and the second `rsem-calculate-expression` ([manual](https://deweylab.github.io/RSEM/rsem-calculate-expression.html)) does the alignment and gene quantification.

## `rsem-prepare-reference`

 A reference index is essentially a lookup table that speeds up the finding of sequence matches for alignment. In the case of a splice-aware aligner, the reference index is also aware of the various isoforms of genes in the gene model.

To use `rsem-prepare-reference` ([manual](https://deweylab.github.io/RSEM/rsem-prepare-reference.html)) we would need the FASTA sequence for the reference genome, and the gene model in the form of a GTF, as discussed in the previous section.

> **Note**: We will avoid running RSEM+STAR in this workshop because of the computational requirements and our limited Amazon instance. We would also recommend not running it on a personal computer for the same reason.

If we were to have a genome FASTA in hand, call it `GRCm38.fasta` and a GTF in hand, call it `GRCm38.gtf`, then we would create the reference index by calling:

```
$ rsem-prepare-reference --gtf /path/to/GRCm38.gtf \
                         --star \
                         --num-threads 8 \
                         /path/to/GRCm38
                         /desired/path/to/index/GRCm38
```

**Note**, the `/path/to/GRCm38` line is a bit odd in that we might expect to give the path to the genome FASTA file, but `rsem-prepare-reference` only wants the *prefix*, so everything up to the file extension.

The result of `rsem-prepare-reference` is a folder containing files for RSEM and STAR to be able to look up genomic location and gene model information as quickly and efficiently as possible.

## `rsem-calculate-expression`

After preparing the reference index, we can do alignment and quantification with the `rsem-calculate-expression` ([manual](https://deweylab.github.io/RSEM/rsem-calculate-expression.html)) command using the FASTQ reads and the path to the reference index:

```
$ rsem-calculate-expression --star \
                            --num-threads 8 \
                            --star-gzipped-read-file \
                            --star-output-genome-bam \
                            --paired-end \
                            /path/to/example_R1.fastq.gz /path/to/example_R2.fastq.gz \
                            /path/to/index/GRCm38
                            /path/to/example
```

RSEM+STAR, with the above options, outputs the following files:

| File | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `example.genome.bam` | The alignments in genomic coordinates. Used for visualization in a gennome browser such as [IGV](https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/). |
| `example.transcript.bam` | The alignments in transcriptomic coordinates. Not used for this workshop. |
| `example.genes.results` | Gene-level results to be used in downstream DE analysis. |
| `example.isoforms.results` | Isoform-level results. Not used for this workshop. |

# Output of RSEM+STAR

The two results we will use most often from RSEM+STAR are the gene-level quantifications (`example.genes.results`) and the alignments in genome-coordinates (`example.genome.bam`). Each sample for which we run RSEM+STAR will have these output files named after the sample.

## Genome Alignments

The `example.genome.bam` alignments file is a special, compressed, version of a SAM file (sequence alignment/map). In order to view it, we have to use a special program called [`samtools`](https://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools.html).

If we were too peek inside of `example.genome.bam`, we would see:

```
(workshop) $ samtools view example.genome.bam | head

```

The [SAM format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAM_(file_format)) gives information about where each read maps to in the genome, and has information about that mapping.

## Gene-level Quantification

If we were to look at the top 3 lines of `example.genes.results`, we see it is a plain-text file separated by tabs where each row is a gene, and the columns are described the first row. The `genes.results` files for each sample can be directly imported into DESeq2 using the [`tximport`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/tximport/inst/doc/tximport.html#rsem) R Bioconductor package. More on this tomorrow.
