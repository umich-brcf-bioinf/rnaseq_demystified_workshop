# Wrapping up RNA-Seq Demystified

## In summary

We hope you now have more familiarity with key concepts, data types, tools, and how they all 
connect to enable gene expression analysis from bulk RNA-Seq data.
  
- Day 1: UNIX, experimental design, sequence file types, QC, process of producing a count table
- Day 2: R, DESeq2, QC visualizations, process of differential expression analysis
- Learning bioinformatic analyses more like a process than a task

## Housekeeping

- Linux/Unix workshop compute environment (at Amazon) will be available until Friday.

- We will email you a link to the session recordings by next week.

- Please take our optional [post-workshop survey](https://forms.gle/bsqTx6GVsxMvye169) (5-10 minutes) <br />
