## Objectives

- Introduce the overall differential expression workflow.
- Understand the importance of replicates and batch effects.
- Introduce different types of library preps, and their requirements.
- Introduce how sequencing works.
- Understand how to estimate how many reads are needed for an experiment.

## Transcriptomics

- RNA-seq measures the transcriptome, the biological material in the cell arising from transcription. It has many uses:
    - Differential gene expression: a *quantitative* evaluation and comparison of transcript levels between groups of samples.
    - Transcriptome assembly: a *qualitative* profile of transcribed regions of the genome.
    - Construct better gene models.
    - Metatranscriptomics or community transcriptome analysis.

# Experimental Design and Practicalities

## Replicates

## Batch Effects

- Batch effects are introduced when groups of samples are handled in distinct ways. This can take many forms:
    - Processing case samples on Monday and control samples on Tuesday.
    - Having one student process case samples and another process control samples.
    - Running a group of samples on one type of sequencer and another group of samples on another.
- As much as possible, treat all samples the same, and never confound with case and control.

## Library Types

- The [Univeristy of Michigan Advanced Genomics Core (AGC)](https://brcf.medicine.umich.edu/cores/advanced-genomics/) has [recommendations](https://brcf.medicine.umich.edu/cores/advanced-genomics/sample-requirements/) for starting amounts and quality.

| Preparation Type | RNA Measured | Recommended |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| polyA | mRNA | Typical for DE analysis. |
| Total RNA | mRNA and long-noncoding RNA | Interested in other RNA types. Organism lacks polyA, e.g. bacterial DNA|
| QuantSeq | mRNA | Cost-effective microarray replacement. Good for low RIN scores. |

## RNA Integrity Number

- Essentially a ratio of 28S to 16S ribosmal RNA that measures the degradation of the RNA.
- Scale of 0 (very degraded) to 10 (not degraded).
- AGC also has [recommendations](https://brcf.medicine.umich.edu/cores/advanced-genomics/sample-requirements/) for RIN scores for different library preparation types.

## How Many Reads?

- [ENCODE guidelines](https://www.encodeproject.org/documents/cede0cbe-d324-4ce7-ace4-f0c3eddf5972/@@download/attachment/ENCODE%20Best%20Practices%20for%20RNA_v2.pdf) recommend 30-40 million reads per human sample.
- For other organisms, scaling to the size of the transcriptome is a good start.

## Paired-end or Single-end?
- Shared flowcells are enabling paired-end (PE) reads to compete with single-end (SE) reads on price.
    - The [AGC Cost Estimator](https://agc-estimator.brcf.med.umich.edu/) bears this out:
        - ~400M SE 75bp reads for 12 samples is $4,253
        - ~400M PE 150bp reads for 12 samples is $3,156
- PE reads have other advantages:
    - Better alignments.
    - Better able to infer isoform usage.
